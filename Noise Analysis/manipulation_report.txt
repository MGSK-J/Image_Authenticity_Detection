    --- Detailed Analysis ---
    The algorithm analyzes inconsistencies in the image noise to detect potential manipulations.
    It calculates the local noise variance and thresholds it to identify regions with unusual noise patterns.
    These regions are then highlighted with red rectangles in the output image.

    Further analysis might involve adjusting the `window_size`, `threshold`, and `kernel_size` parameters
    to fine-tune the detection sensitivity and reduce false positives or negatives.
